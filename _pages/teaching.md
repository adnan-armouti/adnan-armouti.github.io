As of Fall 2022, I have completed the UCLA ECE department's requirements to become a Teaching Assistant (TA). I plan to TA in the ECE department's upper division undergraduate courses for the Winter 2023 and Spring 2023 academic terms. This page will be updated with any announcements, as well as my teaching portfolio and materials.

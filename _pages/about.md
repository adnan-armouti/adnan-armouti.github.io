I am an incoming Computer Science PhD candidate at [Cornell Tech](https://tech.cornell.edu/) advised by Prof. [Rajalakshmi Nandakumar](https://tech.cornell.edu/people/rajalakshmi-nandakumar/). My research interests span wireless sensing, computer vision and multimodal sensor fusion for applications in scene understanding, human-centered sensing, and affective computing. Previously, I completed my Master of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering at UCLA, advised by [Professor Achuta Kadambi](https://www.ee.ucla.edu/achuta-kadambi/) at the [Visual Machines Group](https://visual.ee.ucla.edu/). I also completed my Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering and Bachelor of Arts in Economics at UCLA, funded by the [NSF REU Fellowship](https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/). I've received the [Intel URP Scholarship](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/diversity/scholars-program-scholarships.html), [SRC URP Scholarship](https://www.src.org/program/undergrad/), [UCLA ECE Distinguished Master’s Thesis](/files/pdf/22_23_Distinguished_Thesis_Award.pdf#MS), and [UCLA ECE Outstanding Master’s Student](/files/pdf/22_23_Commencement_Program.pdf#ECE) awards.

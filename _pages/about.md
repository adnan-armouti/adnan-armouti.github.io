I am an MS candidate at the [Visual Machines Group](https://visual.ee.ucla.edu/), advised by [Professor Achuta Kadambi](https://www.ee.ucla.edu/achuta-kadambi/) at UCLA. My research interests encompass computer vision and computational imaging. More specifically, I work on the integration of multisensor hardware stacks and multimodal fusion learning to sense the extra-perceptual, primarily for medical applications. These include medical triaging of vital signs, disease diagnosis (e.g. sleep apnea), and health equity across demographics. Previously, I completed my Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering and Bachelor of Arts in Economics at UCLA, funded by the [NSF REU Fellowship](https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/). I've received the [Intel URP Scholarship](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/diversity/scholars-program-scholarships.html) and [SRC URP Scholarship](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/diversity/scholars-program-scholarships.html) awards.
